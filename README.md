### User Testing

- Users were sent to the website to try and break the website in some way by inputing invalid data where possible.
- They also had tasks to complete which are below
1. Register an account and create a blog post
2. Attempt to edit or delete another users post
3. Edit your own post
4. Delete you own post
5. search for posts that do not exit.

- Feedback from users was a success, however 1 common issue was that the user could not upload their own image. They chose a category image from the selected images available to get round this.

* Could not upload there own image

## Deployment

* Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account
* On the main page click New and Create New App
* Note: new app name must be unique
* Next select your region, I chose Europe.
* Click Create App button
* Click in resources and select Heroku Postgres database
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "SECRET_KEY"
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "CLOUDINARY_URL"
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1"
* The next page is the projectâ€™s Deploy Tab. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars
* Next, go to Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select python and Save Changes
* Scroll to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab
* Select Github as the deployment method
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github
* Create a requirements.txt in the root directory file so Heroku can install the packages needed.
* To update requirements.txt with all package installments type the command in the terminal "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt"
* To obtain the Postgres DATABASE_URL from Heroku, navigate to the resources tab in your app, under the title Add-ons search for Heroku Postgres, submit this option. The DATABASE_URL will be added to config bars automatically.
* To obtain a cloudinary key, navigate to your cloudinary accounts details under the Dashboard tab. Add the url to the cloudinary config var.
* In GitPod create a file called env.py in the root directory.
* Import os in the env.py file then type os.environ["WRITE_KEY_HERE"] = "VALUES_GO_HERE"
* Fill in the above line with the "SECRET_KEY", "CLOUDINARY_URL" AND "DATABASE_URL". The values for each key are found in the config vars in Heroku.


### Final Deployment 

* Create a runtime.txt `python-3.8.13`
* Create a Procfile `web: gunicorn heardit.wsgi`
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
* In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN `to
   settings.py.
* In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`
